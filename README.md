# LCIA Eutrophication

Python 3 package for converting LCIA Characterization Factors (CFs) from native format (e.g., ecoregions, a grid, etc.) to other units (e.g., political), for use in LCIA software. 
CFs are aggregated according to likelihood data (e.g., fertilizer application), which provides more sophistication than a simple area-weighted average.
Data inputs are 
1) shapefiles to define geometry 
2) data to provide CFs (data may be attached to shapefiles, in standalone excel, csv, matlab, numpy files)
Calcluation is controlled by a master excel file.

To be updated to [LCIAmethod format](./format%20specs/LCIAmethod.md).
